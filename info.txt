We have decided to use Yifat's design exclusively for the base,
since her design was much more fluid and flexible, better using the advantages of object-oriented programming and overall more clean and sensible.

Its weaker spots were quickly dealt with together, thanks to its flexibility.

Shoham's design wasn't so well thought-out, and since it failed to be completed in time during the last assignment, we decided to drop it and pick up the pace from here, adding to the more stable structure at hand.

Some of Shoham's previous ideas have been implemented upon Yifat's base files, but in small snippets.

We've come up with ideas and implemented them together / in turns from then on, and our debates have been very fruitful and enjoyable.
